## Yo! 👋

I’m [Surya Atmuri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/surya-atmuri/), a student founder at Georgia Tech driven by one core principle: **solve first, refine later**.  

I want to be a better engineer and recognize the difference between *good code* and *code that works*. 
So I am seeking industry experience and mentorship alongside my startup journey.

Right now, I’m building in two worlds:  
- **Startups** – Creating products to fix problems I’ve faced, and scaling them to reach others who can benefit.  
- **Recruitment** – Sharing my network and resources to help others find better opportunities.  

I believe watching your own work “grow up” is one of the most rewarding experiences - and I hope you see how much I value so here.
