## Yo! 👋

I’m [Surya Atmuri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/surya-atmuri/), a student founder at Georgia Tech driven by one core principle: **solve first, refine later**.  

When I build, I care less about the elegance of the process and more about whether it works—because impact matters.  
But to be a great builder, I also need to recognize the difference between *good code* and *code that works*.  
That’s why I’m seeking industry experience and mentorship alongside my startup journey.

Right now, I’m building in two worlds:  
- **Startups** – Creating products to fix problems I’ve faced, and scaling them to reach others who can benefit.  
- **Recruitment** – Sharing my network and resources to help others find better opportunities.  

I believe watching your own work “grow up” is one of the most rewarding experiences - and I treasure that experience with the product.
